# TODOS

- Profile blank state should say check in
- Style opening hours correctly

## BUGS

### DIFFUCULT TO REPRODUCE/SOLVE

- After receiving update on iOS, redux-persist loader just loaded indefinitely
- If I delete things, store still persists them, e.g. deleted Cederberg search area but it was still there

## ENHANCEMENTS

- Request location permission again if not granted
- Save unique device ID (for easy data retrieval if necessary)
- Facebook sign in

### CODE OPTIMISATIONS

- CI
