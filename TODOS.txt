BUGS

TODOS
    About top margin
    Home menu bottom
    FindPlaceModal needs mark as visited action => then retry
    Search did not get blank state

    Close To Me places calculation will be expensive (need to do this once on load)
        Could also check if isVisited here (this calculation is done multiple times)
    Disable close button of find place modal while finding / Make sure state isn't updated afterwards
